<!-- We must first create a header section or div,
that shows what the game is called. 
It must also feature clickable links to the main (i.e., index) page.
As of right now, we have 2 divs within the header, each with link (a) and h tags,
as well as desired text-->

<!--in one case, 
    1) an announcement or prompt to start the game and give instructions 
    2) a header 'wins' above a box counting the number of wins (i.e., correct guesses) a player has scored 
    3) the underscores with a letter guess above eah
    (these must be equal in number to the amount of letters in the target word)
    4) a header for the number of guesses remaining, under which a box will contain the number of guesses a player may make before losing
    5) a header for the letters the player has already guessed, under which a box will contain a sequence or array of letters the player has already guessed

The other box will contain 
    1)an image file, with a smaller image at the top indicating the nature of the game 
    (maybe a carousel like wheel of fortune but with musical notes on it, etc.). 
    2) another image file, which will pop up (appear--see Captain Planet Javascript function)
    if the player guesses the target word correctly. 
    This image file will be the album art of a '70s album/artist that will correspond to the target word
    3) an mp3 file of the song guessed will play if the word is guessed correctly
    4) there has been, as yet, no condition set for if the word is not correctly guessed 

The target words (i.e., albums, artists) must be stored somewhere in the site,
to be instantiated, one after another, (as underscores of a certain length) with letters then to fill in, 
and to the call forth an mp3 file with the correct guess.
